FINAL COMPOSITION STAGE — MATCH BACKGROUND LIGHTING, COLOR, FOCUS, AND FRAMING
DO NOT CHANGE IDENTITY OR OUTFIT DESIGN

PURPOSE:
Take the subject from the Stage 2 result, remove the original background completely,
and place the person into Background Image 3 so that they look like they were
photographed naturally in that scene.

INPUT:
- Subject: Result of Stage 2 (person wearing the outfit, still with original background).
- Background: Image 3 (the final background scene).

IDENTITY RULES (NEVER BREAK):
- Do NOT change the structural facial features or identity
  (eyes, nose, mouth, face shape).
- Do NOT change the facial expression.
- It IS allowed to change the apparent skin tone and local color of the
  face and skin through lighting, shadow, and color grading adjustments,
  as long as the subject is still clearly recognizable as the same
  individual from Stage 2.

OUTFIT RULES:
- Do NOT change the dress design, silhouette, or length.
- Preserve the overall color family and style of the outfit.
- You MAY adjust brightness, contrast, highlights, and shadows on the dress
  so that it matches the lighting and color of the background scene.

BACKGROUND COMPOSITION:
- Remove the original background behind the subject entirely.
- Use ONLY Background Image 3 as the final background.
- The final image must NOT show any pixels from the original subject background.
- Place the person at a natural scale and perspective inside the scene.
- Prefer to position the person near the horizontal center of the frame,
  slightly below the vertical center so the head is not cropped.
- Ensure the feet are correctly placed on the ground or floor.

LIGHTING AND COLOR MATCHING RULES:
- Use the background image as the primary reference for overall lighting and mood.
- Match the global light direction, intensity, and softness to the background scene.
- Adjust the brightness and exposure of all composited foreground areas so they
  do not look pasted on top of the background.
- Match the color temperature (warm or cool) of the foreground to the background,
  so tones reflect the ambient light of the environment.
- Ensure cast shadows and shading are consistent with the background light
  direction and approximate time of day.
- Add realistic contact shadows where the foreground meets the ground or any
  surfaces, so the composition feels grounded and physically coherent.
- Blend the overall color grading (contrast, saturation, and tint) of foreground
  and background so they share the same photographic style.
- Avoid harsh cutout edges or halos; transitions between foreground and
  background should be smooth and natural.
- If the background has depth-of-field blur (bokeh), adjust the apparent
  sharpness of the foreground slightly so that focus levels feel coherent
  and believable.
- It is acceptable if skin tone appears warmer, cooler, slightly brighter
  or darker than the original, as long as it remains physically plausible
  under the given background lighting.
- Strongly adapt the skin tone and local color of the subject so that it
  clearly reflects the ambient light and color of the background scene.
  The subject should no longer look like it was lit in a different place.
- Do not significantly change the colors, contrast, or exposure of Background Image 3.
  Global color grading is allowed, but the main adaptation must be applied to the
  subject (skin, dress, and local shadows), not to the background.

LIGHTING, COLOR, AND FOCUS MATCH:
- Match the global light direction and strength to the background.
- Darken or brighten the subject if needed so exposure matches the scene.
- Match color temperature (warm/cool) to Background Image 3.
- Add soft ambient light from the surroundings onto the skin and dress.
- Blend skin tones using ambient colors from the environment.
- Add or refine realistic contact shadows under and around the feet.
- Apply the same level of sharpness or blur (depth of field) to the subject
  as in the background so they share a single focus plane.
- Apply subtle global color grading so the subject and background feel
  like one unified photograph.

NATURAL BLENDING:
- Ensure there are no visible cutout edges or halos around the subject.
- Avoid double backgrounds, ghosting, or mismatched lighting.
- Do NOT distort the pose or body proportions.

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Don't replace the person with a different individual.
- Don't change clothing or shoes into a different style.
- Don't smooth the face excessively or add heavy makeup.
- Don't change the facial expression.

OUTPUT:
Return a single photorealistic image where the person from the subject
is seamlessly integrated into Background Image 3, with harmonized lighting,
color, focus, and a natural centered composition, and with NO remaining
traces of the original background.
