STAGE 2 — STRICT OUTFIT REPLACEMENT
TASK: APPLY THE OUTFIT FROM IMAGE 2 ONTO THE PERSON IN IMAGE 1.

MANDATORY "OVERWRITE" INSTRUCTIONS:
1. IGNORE THE ORIGINAL CLOTHING VOLUME. If the original person is wearing a thick sweater, ignore its puffiness. Estimate the slimmer body underneath to fit the new outfit.
2. ERASE ORIGINAL COLORS. If the original pants are black, DO NOT allow black pixels to bleed into the new legs or dress.
3. ERASE ORIGINAL TEXTURES. If the original top is knitted, the new outfit MUST NOT look knitted unless Image 2 is knitted.

CONTEXT:
- Target: Complete replacement of attire.
- Constraint: Face must remain identical.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Apply the outfit from Image 2 (Length, Color, Material) exactly.
- If the new outfit is sleeveless, generate realistic skin texture for the arms.
- If the new outfit is a short dress, generate realistic skin texture for the legs.
- Completely replace the footwear with shoes matching the new style (Heels/Dress shoes).

WHAT TO AVOID (STRICT):
- NO traces of the original white/bulky top.
- NO traces of the original black/dark pants.
- NO hybrid textures (e.g., a dress with sweater wrinkles).
- NO original sneakers.

OUTPUT:
A photorealistic image where the person is wearing ONLY the new outfit.
